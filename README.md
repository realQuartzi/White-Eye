# WhiteEye

WhiteEye is a Discord Whitelisting bot.  
Its functionality is to remove users from the server when they first join if they are not whitelisted.

**How does the whitelisting work?**  
How the bot does this whitelisting is through a json file which collects the Unique IDs of the user into a list which the bot will read and compare with the user that just joined. If the UserID does not match up with any ID in the json file then the user will simply be kicked from the server.

**How is the bot able to differentiate from different servers?**  
The bots json file name is named after the server's unique ID and therefore can easily be specifically targeted.

## WhiteEye-CS

The bot uses the Discord.Net package.

To run the bot just compile the csproj into an executable and run it.  
If a token file is not available the bot will create a token file and ask you to fill the file with your bot token.Â´ 
The data directory will automatically be created, as aswell the whitelist files.  

Only users with these permissions are able to use the upcoming commands:
